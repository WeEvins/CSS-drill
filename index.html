                Rules to join the Lazy Peopleâ€™s Club for the Sleepy and Tired:
                <br> 1) One must love sleep. Sleep is love. Sleep is life.
                <br> 2) One must be tired. Physically or emotionally, both are acceptable.
                <br> 3) One must love video games. Halfhearted interest in video games will result in immediate termination of
                membership.
                <br> Fortunately,
                <span style="color:darkcyan"> Noctis </span> falls into all three categories.
