                Rules to join the Lazy Peopleâ€™s Club for the Sleepy and Tired:
                <br> 1) One must love sleep. Sleep is love. Sleep is life.
                <br> 2) One must be tired. Physically or emotionally, both are acceptable.
                <br> 3) One must love video games. Halfhearted interest in video games will result in immediate termination of
                membership.
                <br> Fortunately, Noctis falls into all three categories.

                It was like time had folded on itself and dropped her back off in the middle to relive things she had already done. She can
                change things.<br>
                Do it better. <br>
                The one fault in her retry. Oh there are many faults don't get her started.<br>
